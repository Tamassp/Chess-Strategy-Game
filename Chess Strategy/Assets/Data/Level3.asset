  description: 'The Dark King set up a maze to confuse you with a lot of his close
    range Bishops. \n\n  <b>Bishops (cost: 3 gold)</b>  Bishops are a bit faster
    than regular pawns, they have very fast reload speed, but their range is half
    of the usual. Try to use this to your advantage.'
